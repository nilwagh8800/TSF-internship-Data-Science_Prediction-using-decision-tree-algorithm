**Iris Dataset with Decision Tree Algorithm**

**Overview**
This project is done under The Spark Foundation's Graduate Rotational Internship Program. This project utilizes the famous Iris dataset to demonstrate the implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm. The Iris dataset is a commonly used dataset in machine learning and is used here as an example for classification tasks using a Decision Tree.

Prerequisites, Dataset, Implementation, Results.

**Prerequisites**
Before running the code in this project, ensure that you have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.x recommended) Required Python libraries: scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, graphviz, seaborn

**Dataset**
The Iris dataset is included in the scikit-learn library, so there's no need to download it separately. The dataset consists of 150 samples from three different species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each sample has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Implementation**
The Decision Tree algorithm is implemented using the scikit-learn library. The code for this can be found in the TSF Task6.ipynb file.

**Results**
The results of running the Decision Tree algorithm on the Iris dataset is displayed as 1 in accuracy score which is near to 100%. You can also find visualizations of the Decision Tree and other relevant plots.
